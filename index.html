<h3>A bit about me</h3>
<p>Hi,my name is Erin and I'm a new transfer student here at Columbia. I'm studying Illustration with a minor in Graphic design and I have no prior experience coding. 
I'm not the most tech-sauve of my generation. I think I inherited my mom's confusion with computers, but I know enough to draw digitall! </p>
